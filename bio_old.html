<h2>Biography:</h2>



<p2><img src="images/ryan_guitar_pic.jpg" align="right" />From an early age, I have always been fascinated by visual art.  At the age of 5 I was walking around family functions and parties with my parents old still camera (sometimes with film in it, most times not) taking pictures of whatever caught my eye.  As I got older I began to explore video more.  I also became extremely interested in computers, not just using them but knowing how to fix them or make them run faster.  These two interests merged when I found video editing.  I was using the computer to edit together video montages of moments in time, such as my adopted Chinese cousin’s first year in America.</p>
<p>In high school I took classes in Media Communication for all four years.  This allowed me to break out of the box and create pieces of varied genres and to work with a group of students that shared my passion for video production.  My teachers there taught me the fundamentals from start to finish of production.</p> 
<p>My search for a college that could provide for my unique video and computer science interests led me to Villanova University.  I am a media production concentration within the Communication major and also have a Computer Science minor. At Villanova I have been able to explore the many facets of these areas and gain valuable knowledge and experience through my classes here.  My unique combination of Computer Science with Media Production is distinct from the normal major/minor combinations, but it has made for some awesome opportunities.</p>  

<p>My major interest is creating visual art, whether it be through still photography, edited video or any other means.</p2>
